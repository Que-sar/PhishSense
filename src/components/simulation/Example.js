      <p>Dear Team,</p>

        I hope this email finds you well. I'm excited to announce that our
        annual company picnic is just around the corner, and I wanted to extend
        a warm invitation to all of you and your families.

        <br />
        Location: Riverside Park, Pavilion B

        We have planned a fun-filled day with activities for everyone, including
        games, sports, a delicious BBQ lunch, and even a bouncy castle for the
        kids. It's a fantastic opportunity to unwind, socialize, and strengthen
        our team spirit in a relaxed setting.

        how many people will be attending from your family. Also, don't forget
        to mention any dietary restrictions or allergies we should be aware of.

        Please feel free to bring any outdoor games or sports equipment you'd
        like to share with the team. We encourage everyone to participate and
        have a great time.

        Looking forward to seeing you all at the picnic! If you have any
        questions or need further information, please don't hesitate to reach
